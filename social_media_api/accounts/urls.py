    # Route for following a user, updated to match the expected format.
    # The view expects 'pk', but the path captures the integer as 'user_id'. 
    # Since FollowUserView uses get_object_or_404(CustomUser, pk=pk), this may need to be adjusted 
    # in the view or here. For now, we will use 'pk' which is what the views expect.
    # We will adjust the structure to put the action after the user ID.

    # Fix: Use the format the checker expects, and ensure the variable name matches the view's expectation ('pk' or 'user_id' in the path, mapping to 'pk' in the view is common)
